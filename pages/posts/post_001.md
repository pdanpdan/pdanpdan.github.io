## Where?

You can access it online at [https://pdanpdan.github.io/quasar-play/](https://pdanpdan.github.io/quasar-play/).

You can check the code at [https://github.com/pdanpdan/quasar-play](https://github.com/pdanpdan/quasar-play).

## Why?

Because sometimes

- you need a quick and easy way to test Quasar components
- you want to create and share ideas and prototypes with someone else
- you want to check different versions of Quasar Framework, Vue and Typescript
- you need to provide reproductions for issues

And you want to do it in an easy way, without creating a repository in case of more complex situations.

## Features

- based on [@vue/repl](https://github.com/vuejs/repl)
- uses Monaco editor

  - Quasar Framework v2
  - VueRouter
  - VueI18n
  - Pinia
- code can be writter in Javascript or Typescript
- the result can be shared as URL
- the result can be downloaded as a full stand-alone Vite 5 project

The default example shows how to configure and use all the features in a simple project.

## So...

Play with it, I hope you will enjoy it.
